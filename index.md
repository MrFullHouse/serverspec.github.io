## About

With Serverspec, you can write RSpec tests for checking your servers are configured correctly.

Serverspec tests your servers' **actual state**  through **SSH access**, so you don't need to install any agent softwares on your servers and can use any configuration management tools, [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/), [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/), [CFEngine](http://cfengine.com/) and so on.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'serverspec'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install serverspec

----

## Getting Started

```
$ serverspec-init
Select OS type:

  1) UN*X
  2) Windows

Select number: 1

Select a backend type:

  1) SSH
  2) Exec (local)

Select number: 1

Vagrant instance y/n: n
Input target host name: www.example.jp
 + spec/
 + spec/www.example.jp/
 + spec/www.example.jp/httpd_spec.rb
 + spec/spec_helper.rb
 + Rakefile
```


spec/www.example.jp/httpd_spec.rb is a sample spec file and its content is like this.

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe package('httpd') do
  it { should be_installed }
end

describe service('httpd') do
  it { should be_enabled   }
  it { should be_running   }
end

describe port(80) do
  it { should be_listening }
end

describe file('/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf') do
  it { should be_file }
  its(:content) { should match /ServerName www.example.jp/ }
end
```

You can write spec for testing servers like this.

Serverspec with SSH backend logs in to target servers as a user configured in ``~/.ssh/config`` or a current user. If you'd like to change the user, please edit the below line in ``spec/spec_helper.rb``.

```ruby
      user    = options[:user] || Etc.getlogin
```

Run tests.

```
$ rake spec
/usr/bin/ruby -S rspec spec/www.example.jp/httpd_spec.rb
